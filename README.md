# portfolio-coding

## Description

This is the begining framework of having a working portfolio to show off what work I have done and what skills I have in coding. So far what I know and am able to do is some base html and css. I will be able to consistiantly update this page going forward as I learn new techniques and skills when it comes to web design and coding. Even new tricks that I pick up for CSS and html wil be added. My goal is to turn this from it's current framework into an actual portfolio that I am proud to show off to the world.
